        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>I created a Lights Out puzzle using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The puzzle begins in a solvable configuration by simulating random legal moves on a blank (all-white) board. Each move toggles a cell and its adjacent neighbors, ensuring that the game state is always solvable.</p>
        <p>To check for a win condition, the game listens for clicks and evaluates whether all tiles are white after every move. A popup alert ("You win!") is triggered when the player successfully turns off all the lights.</p>
        <p>The game uses CSS to distinguish between white and black tiles, with the class <code>.is-off</code> controlling the "off" (black) state. I used Comic Sans for a playful style and added a footer to meet the assignment's technical requirements.</p>
        <p>Challenges I encountered included making sure random board configurations were solvable and correctly toggling edge/corner squares. I resolved these by only using simulated click logic for randomization and by checking grid bounds before toggling neighbors.</p>
        <p>This project helped reinforce JavaScript DOM manipulation, event listeners, CSS styling, and logic for grid-based game development.</p>
